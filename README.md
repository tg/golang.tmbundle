## golang.tmbundle v3.1.0
(a TextMate 2 bundle for the go programming language)

### Installation
TextMate by default will detect .go files and load [Jim Dovey's bundle](https://github.com/AlanQuatermain/go-tmbundle). This is a fork with additional improvements merged from around the community.

Big changes from the default version:
- all non-run go commands operate on the current directory instead of per file (thanks [tg](https://github.com/tg))
- run and build work on unsaved files (thanks [tg](https://github.com/tg))
- added print, println, printf, and fprintf snippets (thanks [jish](https://github.com/jish))
- bugfixes

To install this bundle manually, open a Terminal window and do:

```Shell
mkdir ~/Library/Application\ Support/Avian/Bundles
cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Avian/Bundles
git clone git://github.com/syscrusher/golang.tmbundle.git
```


This bundle uses gocode for completion and godoc for documentation, which can be installed with:

```Shell
go get -u github.com/nsf/gocode
go get -u code.google.com/p/go.tools/cmd/godoc
```

### Features
The bundle implements language syntax, completion via gocode, some snippets, and some compile/format/documentation commands for the [Go language](http://golang.org/). 

### Snippets

#### Simple Statements

Snippet		|	Content
------- 	|	-------
Cmd-i		|	'+iota+'
,			|	A pair ('first, second'), suitable for declaring result variables from a multi-return-value function or a map range loop.
<			|	Send/receive through a channel. Provides tab stops for the value and the channel name.
def			|	A default clause within a switch.
fmt			|	fmt.Println with tab stop for interface
fmt.		|	fmt.Printf with tab stops for string and interface
in			|	An empty interface type (i.e. matches anything).
imp			|	An import statement with optional alternative name.
imps		|	A multiple-import statement.
pkg			|	A package declaration including an optional comment block for packages other than 'main'.
ret			|	A return statement with optional return value.

#### Initializers and Declarations

Snippet		|	Content
------- 	|	-------
:			|	A short-form variable initializer (i.e. 'name := value').
\[\]		|	A slice variable type; expands to '[]+type+', so is usable inside other snippets.
ch		|	A channel type.
con		|	A single constant declaration.
cons		|	A multiple constant declaration block.
fun		|	A function type definition statement.
inte		|	An interface definition with a single method.
mk		|	A make statement (used for creating & initializing channels, maps, etc.).
map		|	A map variable type; expands to 'map[+keytype+]+valuetype+'.
ew		|	A new statement (used to create & initialize structure types).
st		|	A struct definition with a single member.
type		|	A type declaration, with name and variable type as tab-stops.
types		|	A block with multiple type declarations.
var		|	Declare a variable with an optional initial value (long form, i.e. 'var x int = 10').
vars		|	A block of long-form variable declarations.

#### Functions

Snippet		|	Content
------- 	|	-------
de		|	A deferred goroutine call (defines the function inline).
func		|	A plain (global) function declaration, with tab stops for name, parameters, and a single optional result.
funcv		|	A plain (global) function declaration, with tab stops for name, parameters, and multiple results.
go		|	An immediate goroutine call (defines the function inline).
init		|	A template for a module's +init()+ function, with a tab stop at its body.
main		|	A template for a +main()+ function with a tab stop at its body.
meth		|	Declares a function on a particular type, with additional tab stops for receiver name and type and a single optional result.
methv		|	Declares a function on a particular type, with additional tab stops for receiver name and type and multiple results.

#### Control Statements

Snippet		|	Content
------- 	|	-------
case		|	A case clause, within a switch or select.
for			|	A for loop.
fori		|	A for loop with an index (similar to C for loops).
forr		|	A for loop iterating over a collection's full range.
if			|	An if statement, properly formatted (Go requires the use of {} on ifs, unlike C; this throws me sometimes).
sel			|	A select statement, for looping over channel conditions.
sw			|	A switch statement with an optional expression.

#### Commands

Shortcut		|	Content
------- 		|	-------
Cmd-K			|	Build the current package or executable.
Cmd-R			|	Compile and run the current file.
Cmd-Opt-T		|	Launch the unittests for the current package using "go test".
Ctrl-Shift-H	|	Reformat the document according to the Go style guidelines.
Ctrl-H			|	Show the Go HTML documentation for the currently-selected symbol.
\<ESC\>			|	Complete the symbol under the cursor.

### Thanks
This is a fork from [Jim Dovey](https://github.com/AlanQuatermain) who has done most of the work in maintaining the bundle and deserves everyone's gratitude. The following are his attributions for this bundle.

>Much of the current infrastructure was created by [Martin Kühl](http://github.com/mkhl), who is a significantly more seasoned TextMate bundle developer than I, and to whom I am eternally grateful.

>Support for Go 1.0 was provided by [Jeremy Whitlock](http://github.com/whitlockjc) and [Michael Sheets](http://github.com/infininight), with additional code and fixes from [Sylvain Defresne](http://github.com/sdefresne), [liuyork](http://github.com/liuyork), and [Alexey Palazhchenko](http://github.com/AlekSi).

>Thanks be to lasersox and Infininight over at the [#textmate room on IRC](irc://irc.freenode.net/textmate) for all their help in cleaning up this here bundle, and for helping me to optimize my regex use in the language grammar.
Thanks to Martin Kühl for his extensive additions to this project's snippets and commands. Also Infininight's work on updating the bundle to use the TextMate's new Ruby interface and Jeremy & Sylvain's work on supporting Go 1.0 has been invaluable. Their assistance and stewardship while I've been deep in the world of Objective-C is very much appreciated.

Happy coding :)
